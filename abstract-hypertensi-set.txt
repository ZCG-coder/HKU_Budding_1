Stroke as a cause of long-term disability is a growing public health burden. 
Therefore, focusing on prevention is important. The most prominent aim of this 
strategy is to treat modifiable risk factors, such as arterial hypertension, the 
leading modifiable contributor to stroke. Thus, efforts to adequately reduce 
Blood Pressure (BP) among hypertensives are mandatory. In this respect, although 
safety and benefits of BP control related to long-term outcome have been largely 
demonstrated, there are open questions that remain to be addressed, such as 
optimal timing to initiate BP reduction and BP goals to be targeted. Moreover, 
evidence on antihypertensive treatment during the acute phase of stroke or BP 
management in specific categories (i.e. patients with carotid stenosis and 
post-acute stroke) remain controversial. This review provides a critical update 
on the current knowledge concerning BP management and stroke pathophysiology in 
patients who are either at risk for stroke or who experienced stroke.

Primary aldosteronism confers a higher risk of stroke, atrial fibrillation, and 
cardiovascular disease than blood pressure matched essential hypertension. It is 
the most common endocrine cause of secondary hypertension with prevalence 
estimates of up to 13% in primary care and 30% in referral centers around the 
world. Unlike essential hypertension, primary aldosteronism has targeted medical 
treatment and potentially curative surgical solutions which can ameliorate the 
associated cardiovascular risks. This narrative review highlights an evidence 
gap in the optimal diagnosis and targeted treatment of primary aldosteronism in 
secondary stroke prevention. Over half of the patients suffering a stroke have 
blood pressure in the hypertensive range and less than a third achieve optimal 
blood pressure control. There are no guideline recommendations to test for 
primary aldosteronism in these patients, although up to 30% of patients with 
resistant hypertension may have this disease. The accurate diagnosis of primary 
aldosteronism could significantly improve blood pressure, simplify the 
medication regimen and reduce the overall cardiovascular risk in these patients. 
The challenges associated with screening for primary aldosteronism following 
stroke may be overcome by novel blood tests which are less affected by 
antihypertensive medications routinely used in stroke care. Approximately 
one-quarter of all strokes occur in patients who have previously had a stroke. 
Modifying hypertension, the leading modifiable risk factor, would, therefore, 
have significant public health implications. As clinicians, we must increase our 
awareness of primary aldosteronism in patients with stroke, particularly in 
those with resistant hypertension, to enable targeted therapy and reduce the 
risk of stroke recurrence.

Regulation of Hypertension for Secondary Prevention of Stroke: The Possible 
'Bridging Function' of Acupuncture.

Zheng H, Han Y, Du Y, Shi X, Huang H, Yu X, Tan X, Hu C, Wang Y, Zhou S.

Worldwide, stroke is the leading cause of mortality and disability, with 
hypertension being an independent risk factor for a secondary stroke. 
Acupuncture for the treatment of hypertension gains more attention in 
alternative and complementary medicine, but the results are inconsistent. Few 
studies regarding the secondary prevention of stroke by managing hypertension 
with acupuncture have been carried out as there are some problems regarding the 
antihypertensive drug status in the secondary prevention of stroke. Still, the 
potential of acupuncture in regulating the blood pressure for secondary stroke 
prevention deserves our focus. This review is based on papers recorded in the 
PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases, from their inception until March 
28, 2017, and retrieved with the following search terms: hypertension and 
acupuncture, limited in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), stress-induced 
(or cold-induced) hypertensive or pre-hypertensive models. We find that, in 
these hypertensive animals, acupuncture could mainly influence factors related 
to the nervous system, oxidative stress, the endocrine system, cardiovascular 
function, and hemorheology, which are closely associated with the stroke 
outcome. This trend may give us a hint that acupuncture might well participate 
in the secondary prevention of stroke through these pathways when used in the 
management of hypertension.

Hypertension is an established target for long-term stroke prevention but 
procedures for management of hypertension in acute stroke are less certain. 
Here, we analyze basic science data to examine the impact of hypertension on 
candidate stroke therapies and of anti-hypertensive treatments on stroke 
outcome.
METHODS: Data were pooled from 3,288 acute ischemic stroke experiments (47,899 
animals) testing the effect of therapies on infarct size (published 1978-2010). 
Data were combined using meta-analysis and meta-regression, partitioned on the 
basis of hypertension, stroke model, and therapy.
RESULTS: Hypertensive animals were used in 10% of experiments testing 502 
therapies. Hypertension was associated with lower treatment efficacy, especially 
in larger infarcts. Overall, anti-hypertensives did not provide greater benefit 
than other drugs, although benefits were evident in hypertensive animals even 
when given after stroke onset. Fifty-eight therapies were tested in both 
normotensive and hypertensive animals: some demonstrated superior efficacy in 
hypertensive animals (hypothermia) while others worked better in normotensive 
animals (tissue plasminogen activator, anesthetic agents).
DISCUSSION: Hypertension has a significant effect on the efficacy of candidate 
stroke drugs: standard basic science testing may overestimate the efficacy which 
could be reasonably expected from certain therapies and for hypertensive 
patients with large or temporary occlusions.

Update of
    Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2017 Aug 08;8:CD011575. doi: 
10.1002/14651858.CD011575.pub2.

BACKGROUND: This is an update of the original Cochrane review, published in 
2017. Eight out of 10 major antihypertensive trials in adults, 65 years of age 
or older, attempted to achieve a target systolic blood pressure (BP) of < 160 
mmHg. Collectively, these trials demonstrated cardiovascular benefit for 
treatment, compared to no treatment, for older adults with BP > 160 mmHg. 
However, an even lower BP target of < 140 mmHg is commonly applied to all age 
groups. Yet the risk and benefit of antihypertensive therapy can be expected to 
vary across populations, and some observational evidence suggests that older 
adults who are frail might have better health outcomes with less aggressive BP 
lowering. Current clinical practice guidelines are inconsistent in target BP 
recommendations for older adults, with systolic BP targets ranging from < 130 
mmHg to < 150 mmHg. The 2017 review did not find compelling evidence of a 
reduction in any of the primary outcomes, including all-cause mortality, stroke, 
or total serious cardiovascular adverse events, comparing a lower BP target to a 
higher BP target in older adults with hypertension. It is important to update 
this review to explore if new evidence exists to determine whether older adults 
might do just as well, better, or worse with less aggressive pharmacotherapy for 
hypertension.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of a less aggressive blood pressure target (in 
the range of < 150 to 160/95 to 105 mmHg), compared to a conventional or more 
aggressive BP target (of < 140/90 mmHg or lower) in hypertensive adults, 65 
years of age or older.
SEARCH METHODS: For this update, Cochrane Hypertension's Information Specialist 
searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to June 
2024: Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE Ovid, and 
Embase Ovid, and the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register 
ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing trials. We also contacted authors of relevant 
papers requesting information on further published and unpublished work. The 
searches had no language restrictions.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised trials of hypertensive older adults 
(≥ 65 years) that spanned at least one year, and reported the effect on 
mortality and morbidity of a higher or lower systolic or diastolic BP treatment 
target. Higher BP targets ranged from systolic BP < 150 to 160 mmHg or diastolic 
BP < 95 to 105 mmHg; lower BP targets were 140/90 mmHg or lower, measured in an 
ambulatory, home, or office setting.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently screened and selected 
trials for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and certainty of the evidence, and 
extracted data. We combined data for dichotomous outcomes using the risk ratio 
(RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). For continuous outcomes, we used mean 
difference (MD). Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, stroke, 
institutionalisation, and serious cardio-renal vascular adverse events. 
Secondary outcomes included cardiovascular mortality, non-cardiovascular 
mortality, unplanned hospitalisation, each component of cardiovascular serious 
adverse events separately (including cerebrovascular disease, cardiac disease, 
vascular disease, and renal failure), total serious adverse events, total minor 
adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse effects, systolic BP achieved, and 
diastolic BP achieved.
MAIN RESULTS: With the addition of one new trial, we included four trials in 
this updated review (16,732 older adults with a mean age of 70.3 years). Of 
these, one trial used a combined systolic and diastolic BP target and compared a 
higher target of < 150/90 mmHg to a lower target of < 140/90 mmHg, and two 
trials utilised a purely systolic BP target, and compared a systolic BP < 150 
mmHg (1 trial) and a systolic BP < 160 mmHg (1 trial), to a systolic BP < 140 
mmHg. The fourth and newest trial also utilised a systolic BP target, but also 
introduced a lower limit for systolic BP. It compared systolic BP in the target 
range of 130 to 150 mmHg to a lower target range of 110 to 130 mmHg. The 
evidence shows that treatment to the lower BP target over two to four years may 
result in little to no difference in all-cause mortality (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.95 
to 1.37; 4 studies, 16,732 participants; low-certainty evidence), but the lower 
BP target does reduce stroke (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.67; 4 studies, 16,732 
participants; high-certainty evidence), and likely reduces total serious 
cardiovascular adverse events (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.45; 4 studies, 16,732 
participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Adverse effects were not available 
from all trials, but the lower BP target likely does not increase withdrawals 
due to adverse effects (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.33; 3 studies, 16,008 
participants; moderate-certainty evidence).
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: When comparing a higher BP target, in the range of < 150 
to 160/95 to 105 mmHg, to a lower BP target of 140/90 or lower, over two to four 
years of follow-up, there is high-certainty evidence that the lower BP target 
reduces stroke, and moderate-certainty evidence that the lower BP target likely 
reduces serious cardiovascular events. The effect on all-cause mortality is 
unclear (low-certainty evidence), and the lower BP target likely does not 
increase withdrawals due to adverse effects (moderate-certainty evidence). 
Although additional research is warranted in those who are 80 years of age and 
older, and those who are frail (in whom risks and benefits may differ), 
conventional BP targets may be appropriate for the majority of older adults.

High blood pressure (BP) is the strongest risk factor for stroke. It is 
estimated that almost 50% of strokes may be attributable to hypertension. Both 
diastolic and isolated systolic hypertension are important predictors of primary 
or recurrent strokes, and even minor decreases in BP can reduce the risk of 
stroke. While the primary prevention of stroke through the treatment of 
hypertension is well established, the issue of lowering BP after a stroke has 
been uncertain, particularly since this might worsen cerebral perfusion if 
autoregulation remains chronically damaged or severe carotid artery stenosis is 
present. Furthermore, there is substantial evidence to support BP lowering for 
prevention of a first stroke; however, few trials have focused on 
antihypertensive therapy for recurrent stroke prevention. In fact, currently, BP 
management in patients with strokes remains problematic, and questions such as 
the choice of antihypertensive drug and by how much to reduce BP are yet to be 
resolved. Recently, the American Heart Association and American Stroke 
Association published updated guidelines for recurrent stroke prevention, and 
new recommendations on BP management have been included. Our review presents the 
most recent evidence on the management of hypertension in patients who have had 
a stroke.

Uncertainty remains regarding the association between resting heart rate (RHR) 
with hypertension and stroke because of limited and inconsistent data. We 
assessed the association between RHR, hypertension, and stroke. In this 
cross-sectional study, 14 677 participants from the China Hypertension Survey 
study were analyzed. The history of stroke was conducted by questionnaires. RHR 
was measured by the standardized electronic monitors. Multivariate logistic 
regression analyses were performed to evaluate the association between RHR, 
hypertension, and stroke. Moreover, a generalized additive model (GAM) and 
smooth curve fitting (penalized spline method) were conducted to assess the 
association between RHR and stroke in different status of hypertension. Overall, 
each 10 beats per minute (bpm) increase in RHR was associated with an 18% 
increased prevalence of stroke (P = 0.017). Subjects with RHR > 80 bpm were 
associated with a higher prevalence of stroke (OR = 1.47; 95% CI, 1.08-2.01) 
compared with those with RHR ≤ 80 bpm. Similarly, hypertensives had a higher 
prevalence of stroke than normotensives (OR = 3.76; 95% CI, 2.39-5.92). 
Hypertensives with RHR > 80 bpm had the highest prevalence of stroke compared 
with their counterparts (OR = 5.47; 95% CI, 3.13-9.56). The fully adjusted 
smooth curve fitting presented a linear association between RHR and stroke among 
participants with hypertension, but almost horizontal association among 
participants without hypertension. In conclusion, elevated RHR and hypertension 
were independently and jointly associated with the increased prevalence of 
stroke. These findings suggested that elevated RHR was associated with increased 
prevalence of stroke especially among hypertensives.

Objectives: To understand the perception of stroke in the hypertensive 
population. Hypertension is the primary risk factor for stroke, and current 
approaches to stroke prevention are inadequate and often fragmented. 
Understanding the perception of stroke among individuals with hypertension is 
crucial for a targeted approach. However, empirical evidence on this perception 
is limited. Methods: A qualitative design involved thematic analysis of focus 
groups and interview data from urban China with hypertension. Audio recordings 
were transcribed and subjected to thematic analysis. Results: Three themes were 
identified. Hypertensive participants first identified stroke patients by their 
obvious physical disability, and then identified the disease as a negative 
thing. Finally, they wanted to stay away from stroke, but paradoxically, there 
is a contradictory approach to avoidance and prevention, such as being willing 
to prevent the disease or simply avoiding socializing with stroke patients. 
Conclusion: Hypertensive patients hold complex and diverse perceptions of 
stroke, including a certain stigma. Future public health education should 
prioritize improving media promotion and fostering interaction between patients 
with hypertension and stroke in the community.

Stroke continues to be one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity 
worldwide. There are 2 main types of stroke: ischaemic strokes, which are caused 
by obstruction of the blood vessels leading to or within the brain, and 
haemorrhagic strokes, which are induced by the disruption of blood vessels. 
Stroke is a disease of multifactorial aetiology that may develop as an end state 
in patients with serious vascular conditions--most notably, uncontrolled 
arterial hypertension--thereby necessitating the effective control of this risk 
factor to prevent stroke or its recurrence. This paper focuses specifically on 
the epidemiology and pathogenesis of ischaemic stroke mainly in chronically 
hypertensive patients and pays particular attention to the efficacy of a select 
group of routinely used major antihypertensive drugs (i.e., 
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II type 1 receptor 
blockers, and calcium channel blockers) in the treatment of strokes.

Controlling resistant hypertension.

Resistant hypertension (failure to achieve target blood pressures with three or 
more antihypertensive drugs including a diuretic) is an important and 
preventable cause of stroke. Hypertension is highly prevalent in China (>60% of 
persons above age 65), and only ~6% of hypertensives in China are controlled to 
target levels. Most strokes occur among persons with resistant hypertension; 
approximately half of strokes could be prevented by blood pressure control. 
Reasons for uncontrolled hypertension include (1) non-compliance; (2) 
consumption of substances that aggravated hypertension, such as excess salt, 
alcohol, licorice, decongestants and oral contraceptives; (3) therapeutic 
inertia (failure to intensify therapy when target blood pressures are not 
achieved); and (4) diagnostic inertia (failure to investigate the cause of 
resistant hypertension). In China, an additional factor is lack of availability 
of appropriate antihypertensive therapy in many healthcare settings. Sodium 
restriction in combination with a diet similar to the Cretan Mediterranean or 
the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet can lower blood pressure 
in proportion to the severity of hypertension. Physiologically individualised 
therapy for hypertension based on phenotyping by plasma renin activity and 
aldosterone can markedly improve blood pressure control. Renal hypertension 
(high renin/high aldosterone) is best treated with angiotensin receptor 
antagonists; primary aldosteronism (low renin/high aldosterone) is best treated 
with aldosterone antagonists (spironolactone or eplerenone); and hypertension 
due to overactivity of the renal epithelial sodium channel (low renin/low 
aldosterone; Liddle phenotype) is best treated with amiloride. The latter is far 
more common than most physicians suppose.

The benefit of pharmacological treatment of hypertension in the prevention of 
cardiovascular diseases has been established mainly in subjects younger than 80 
years of age. The consequences of undertreatment of hypertension with regard to 
the occurrence of stroke was studied in the Netherlands. About 33% of the 
hypertensives younger than 80 years and 55% of the hypertensives older than 80 
years were not pharmacologically treated, although they were 'candidates' for 
pharmacological treatment of hypertension. About 19% (n = 1350) of all strokes 
that occurred in the Netherlands in 1994 among hypertensives younger than 80 
years may be attributable to untreated hypertension. Among hypertensives older 
than 80 years this percentage was 32% (n = 1345). Although the benefit of 
pharmacological treatment of hypertension in persons older than 80 years has not 
been established experimentally, the results suggest that a considerable 
proportion of the strokes among this group of hypertensives may be prevented.

AIMS: We aimed to assess the relationship between lipid accumulation product 
(LAP) and stroke incidence and whether increased LAP would further enlarge the 
risk of stroke in participants with hypertension in an Inner Mongolian 
population of China.
METHODS: Based on the baseline survey conducted in 2002-2003, a prospective 
cohort study was conducted among 2547 Mongolian people from Inner Mongolia, 
China. LAP was calculated by waist circumference (WC) and triglyceride (TG) 
concentration for men and women, respectively. Cox proportional hazards models 
and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate the 
associations between LAP, hypertension, and stroke incidence.
RESULTS: During the follow-up period, a total of 121 stroke events were 
observed. Participants with higher LAP were associated with higher risk of 
stroke [adjusted hazard ratio (HR), 1.67; 95% confidence interval (CI), 
1.08-2.58] than the participants in the lower LAP group. However, no significant 
dose-response relationship was detected between LAP levels and risk of stroke 
(P-trend=0.103). The Kaplan-Meier curves showed that hypertensives with high LAP 
had highest cumulative stroke incidence rate (log-rank P ＜0.001). The 
multivariate-adjusted HRs (95% CIs) of stroke for normotensives with high LAP, 
hypertensives with low LAP, and hypertensives with high LAP were 1.80 
(0.84-3.89), 2.94 (1.51-5.74), and 4.23 (2.15-8.34), respectively, compared with 
normotensives with low LAP.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed that high LAP was associated with an 
increased risk of future stroke, and hypertensives with high LAP had the highest 
risk of stroke among Inner Mongolians. These findings indicate that LAP and 
hypertension may be valuable to predict and prevent stroke incidence.

Data clearly indicate that treatment with antihypertensive drugs reduces the 
incidence of all strokes in men (by 34%), women (by 38%), elderly persons (by 
36%), including those older than 80 years (by 34%), younger persons, those with 
systolic and diastolic hypertension, persons with isolated systolic 
hypertension, and in those with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack 
(by 28%). Blood pressure should be reduced to less than 140/90 mm Hg. The 
overall data also suggest that reduction of stroke in persons with hypertension 
is related more to a reduction in blood pressure than to the type of 
antihypertensive drugs used.

Systemic hypertension is the most common, most easily diagnosed, and one of the 
most reversible risk factors for neurologic pathology. Acute severe hypertension 
above a mean arterial pressure of approximately 150mmHg exceeds the brain's 
autoregulatory capacity and results in increased cerebral blood flow leading to 
hypertensive encephalopathy. Chronic hypertension predisposes to cerebral 
vasculature atherosclerosis, medial hypertrophy, luminal narrowing, endothelial 
dysfunction, impaired arterial relaxation, and decreased ability to augment 
cerebral blood flow at low blood pressures. The pathologic effects of 
hypertension increase stroke risk by three- to fivefold. With three-fourths of 
strokes incident events, primary prevention is essential. Multiple studies have 
demonstrated the benefit of blood pressure lowering in reducing incident and 
recurrent strokes. Even more, hypertension is a risk factor for cognitive 
impairment and dementia through multifactorial mechanisms including vascular 
compromise, cerebral small vessel disease, white matter disease (leukoaraiosis), 
cerebral microbleeds, cerebral atrophy, amyloid plaque deposition, and 
neurofibrillary tangles. In patients without hypotension, treatment with 
antihypertensives slows progression and assuages the degree of cognitive 
decline. While the choice of antihypertensive did not make a significant 
difference in most cognitive outcome studies, some large meta-analyses have 
pointed to angiotensin receptor blockers as the favored agent. Because of the 
well-documented morbidity and mortality associated with unchecked hypertension, 
treating and preventing hypertension are universally critical pillars in 
healthcare.

BACKGROUND: In some African countries, more than half of the adult population 
are estimated to be hypertensive leading to an escalated burden of stroke in the 
continent. We conducted the first study to unravel the major risk factors for 
stroke among hypertensive patients (Nigerian-Africans) using a case-control 
design while also exploring the relative contributions of carotid intima medial 
thickness (CIMT) and carotid diameter as risk markers for stroke.
METHODS: Using conventional techniques, stroke-related demographic, clinical and 
laboratory data were obtained from 135 consecutive volunteering hypertensive 
stroke patients and compared with 117 age and gender-matched hypertensive 
patients with no clinical evidence of stroke, TIA or coronary artery disease. 
Common carotid IMT and diameters were measured in all participants. Univariate 
and multivariate analyses were conducted at p=0.05.
RESULTS: 13.2% of the stroke patients were first diagnosed as hypertensive at 
presentation with stroke. Among hypertensive patients, the modifiable factors 
significantly (p<0.00001 to p<0.037) associated with stroke occurrence included 
higher maximum and minimum blood pressures in the preceding 3months, higher 
fasting plasma glucose, greater alcohol consumption, lesser physical activity 
and increased CIMT. Using a multivariate model which predicted 84.6% of stroke 
occurrence, only fasting total cholesterol of >150mg/dl (p=0.021) and common 
carotid diameter of ≥5.9mm (p=0.008) independently multiplied the risk of 
stroke.
CONCLUSIONS: Particularly in resource-limited settings, aside from BP control, 
stroke prevention efforts should be targeted towards these identified risk 
factors for stroke among hypertensive patients. Carotid diameter should be 
further explored as an intermediate risk marker for stroke.

CONTEXT: The Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP) demonstrated 
that treating isolated systolic hypertension in older patients decreased 
incidence of total stroke, but whether all types of stroke were reduced was not 
evaluated.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate antihypertensive drug treatment effects on incidence 
of stroke by type and subtype, timing of strokes, case-fatality rates, stroke 
residual effects, and relationship of attained systolic blood pressure to stroke 
incidence.
DESIGN: The SHEP study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial 
began March 1, 1985, and had an average follow-up of 4.5 years.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 4736 men and women aged 60 years or older 
with isolated systolic hypertension at 16 clinical centers in the United States.
INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive treatment with 12.5 
mg/d of chlorthalidone (step 1); either 25 mg/d of atenolol or 0.05 mg/d of 
reserpine (step 2) could be added (n = 2365); or placebo (n = 2371).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Occurrence, type and subtype, and timing of first strokes 
and stroke fatalities; and change in stroke incidence for participants (whether 
in active treatment or placebo groups) reaching study-specific systolic blood 
pressure goal (decrease of at least 20 mm Hg from baseline to below 160 mm Hg) 
compared with participants not reaching goal.
RESULTS: A total of 85 and 132 participants in the active treatment and placebo 
groups, respectively, had ischemic strokes (adjusted relative risk [RR], 0.63; 
95% confidence interval [CI], 0.48-0.82); 9 and 19 had hemorrhagic strokes 
(adjusted RR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.21-1.02); and 9 and 8 had strokes of unknown type 
(adjusted RR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.40-2. 73), respectively. Four subtypes of ischemic 
stroke were observed in active treatment and placebo group participants, 
respectively, as follows: for lacunar, n = 23 and n = 43 (adjusted RR, 0.53; 95% 
CI, 0.32-0.88); for embolic, n = 9 and n = 16 (adjusted RR, 0.56; 95% CI, 
0.25-1.27); for atherosclerotic, n = 13 and n = 13 (adjusted RR, 0. 99; 95% CI, 
0.46-2.15); and for unknown subtype, n = 40 and n = 60 (adjusted RR, 0.64; 95% 
CI, 0.43-0.96). Treatment effect was observed within 1 year for hemorrhagic 
strokes but was not seen until the second year for ischemic strokes. Stroke 
incidence significantly decreased in participants attaining study-specific 
systolic blood pressure goals.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, antihypertensive drug treatment reduced the 
incidence of both hemorrhagic and ischemic (including lacunar) strokes. 
Reduction in stroke incidence occurred when specific systolic blood pressure 
goals were attained. JAMA. 2000;284:465-471

BACKGROUND: Little was known about the different predictive power of blood 
pressure (BP) parameters (SBP, systolic BP; mean arterial pressure, MAP; pulse 
pressure, PP; and diastolic BP, DBP) and stroke incidence. This study's aim was 
to compare power of BP parameters predict stroke events among rural dwelling 
Chinese individuals with hypertension.
METHOD: A total of 5097 hypertension patients (56.2% women; mean age, 
56.3 ± 11.2 years) were included in the prospective cohort study with a median 
follow-up of 8.4 years.
RESULTS: Until the end of the last follow-up, there were 501 onset strokes (310 
ischemic, 186 hemorrhagic, and 5 unclassified strokes) among the 5097 
participants. The results showed that hazard ratio (HR) (95% confidence 
interval, 95% CI) with an increment of 5 mmHg were 1.095 (1.070-1.121) for PP, 
1.173 (1.139-1.208) for MAP, 1.109(1.089-1.130) for SBP, 1.143(1.104-1.185) for 
DBP. The SBP indicated the largest β coefficient in the Cox proportional hazard 
model for all stroke except PP or MAP, and the SBP revealed slightly higher 
value than MAP (βSBP = 0.435, βMAP = 0.430, P = 0.756).
CONCLUSIONS: Both PP and MAP were predictive factors for stroke. The MAP showed 
a stronger ability to predict stroke events than PP, and slightly inferior to 
SBP for hypertension patients.

BACKGROUND: Several observational studies have shown that treated hypertensives 
are characterized as having worse prognosis than nonhypertensives. However, 
there is little evidence based on home blood pressure (home BP) measurement. We 
compare the risk of stroke between untreated individuals and those taking 
antihypertensive medication based on home BP and casual-screening BP (casual BP) 
in the general population.
METHODS: The study included 1,690 untreated and 700 treated subjects aged >or=35 
years. We measured home BP and casual BP at the beginning of the study. The risk 
of first stroke was examined by using the Cox proportional hazards model.
RESULTS: During 11.9 years of follow-up, we observed 242 first-time stroke 
cases. Treated subjects had significantly higher risk for stroke than untreated 
subjects based on home BP (relative hazard (RH) = 1.48) as well as on casual BP 
(RH = 1.78), adjusted for systolic BP values and characteristics. When subjects 
were classified into six categories based on BP (optimal, normal, high normal, 
and grade 1-3 hypertension), RHs in treated hypertensives linearly increased 
(trend P < 0.01) based on home BP. However, there was no consistent association 
for casual BP (trend P: not significant) in treated subjects. Stroke risk was 
linearly increased regardless of the BP information source in untreated subjects 
(home BP: trend P < 0.01, casual BP: trend P < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: The results suggest a strong association between elevated home BP 
and increased risk of stroke. Home BP is a better tool to assess stroke risk, 
especially in treated hypertensives.

The decline in stroke incidence and mortality in the U.S. over the past 20 years 
is reaching a plateau, and the number of strokes may actually start to increase 
as the population ages. However, recent clinical trials have demonstrated that 
there are numerous opportunities to improve stroke prevention strategies and 
also opportunities to effectively intervene in and treat acute strokes. For 
patients with diabetes and for those with prior strokes or transient ischemic 
attacks, it has become evident that aggressive low-density lipoprotein lowering 
with statin medications will decrease the risk for total and fatal strokes. 
Optimal anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy for primary and secondary 
stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation is being carefully defined. With 
numerous novel factor Xa and direct thrombin inhibitor drugs completing phase 
III clinical trials, it is likely that additional oral anticoagulant drugs will 
be clinically available for stroke prevention soon. Additionally, a major 
clinical trial is nearing completion that may resolve the role of carotid 
stenting and carotid endarterectomy in primary and secondary stroke prevention. 
There are recent notable advances in the acute treatment of stroke. It is likely 
that the time window for thrombolysis for appropriate patients with strokes will 
be increased from 3 to 4.5 h, permitting the inclusion of more patients in this 
treatment approach. There is ongoing investigation of intra-arterial 
thrombolysis and of acute intra-arterial thrombus extraction for treatment of 
selected patients with strokes. Unlike the progress in treatment of ischemic 
strokes, treatment of hemorrhagic stroke is progressing more slowly.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There is rapidly growing appreciation that stroke morbidity 
and the risk of an ischaemic stroke becoming haemorrhagic can be influenced by 
new information about prophylaxis, rapid diagnosis and treatment.
RECENT FINDINGS: Strokes are strongly associated with hypertension mainly 
because hypertension is strongly associated with atheromatous deposits blocking 
or narrowing brain arteries, predisposing to local clot formation. Atheroma and 
its ischaemic consequences may damage cerebral arterioles and the brain tissue 
they supply. Cerebral infarcts are more common than spontaneous cerebral 
haemorrhages. High blood pressure itself cannot directly rupture cerebral blood 
vessels because their small size protects them and intracerebral haemorrhage 
usually follows previous ischaemic vascular damage. It is obvious that lowering 
blood pressure would reduce the risk and extent of bleeding into the brain once 
a break in an arteriolar wall has occurred, but it is not clear why lowering 
blood pressure should protect against cerebral infarction. One might expect that 
slowing down the rate of cerebral blood flow would give more time for local 
clots to form. It seems most likely that induced hypotension protects against 
ischaemic strokes by preventing pressure- or ischaemia-induced arteriolar spasm 
and by advantageous vasodilation of some of the more ischaemic territories. 
Added protection can be provided by coenzyme-A reductase inhibitors (statins), 
but probably not by antioxidants.
SUMMARY: Lowering blood pressure strongly protects against ischaemic and 
haemorrhagic stroke. Recent work shows that more accurate and faster diagnosis 
of stroke pathology is urgently needed, so that appropriate treatment (e.g. with 
tissue plasminogen activators) can be started before local bleeding has 
occurred.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Combined effects of socioeconomic position and 
well-established risk factors on stroke incidence have not been formally 
investigated.
METHODS: In a pooled cohort study of 68 643 men and women aged 30 to 70 years in 
Denmark, we examined the combined effect and interaction between socioeconomic 
position (ie, education), smoking, and hypertension on ischemic and hemorrhagic 
stroke incidence by the use of the additive hazards model.
RESULTS: During 14 years of follow-up, 3613 ischemic strokes and 776 hemorrhagic 
strokes were observed. Current smoking and hypertension were more prevalent 
among those with low education. Low versus high education was associated with 
greater ischemic, but not hemorrhagic, stroke incidence. The combined effect of 
low education and current smoking was more than expected by the sum of their 
separate effects on ischemic stroke incidence, particularly among men: 134 (95% 
confidence interval, 49-219) extra cases per 100 000 person-years because of 
interaction, adjusted for age, cohort study, and birth cohort. There was no 
clear evidence of interaction between low education and hypertension. The 
combined effect of current smoking and hypertension was more than expected by 
the sum of their separate effects on ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke incidence. 
This effect was most pronounced for ischemic stroke among women: 178 (95% 
confidence interval, 103-253) extra cases per 100 000 person-years because of 
interaction, adjusted for age, cohort study, and birth cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: Reducing smoking in those with low socioeconomic position and in 
those with hypertension could potentially reduce social inequality stroke 
incidence.
