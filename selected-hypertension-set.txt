BACKGROUND: Hypertension is a major public health challenge affecting more than 
one billion people worldwide; it disproportionately affects populations in low- 
and middle-income countries (LMICs), where health systems are generally weak. 
The increasing prevalence of hypertension is associated with population growth, 
ageing, genetic factors, and behavioural risk factors, such as excessive salt 
and fat consumption, physical inactivity, being overweight and obese, harmful 
alcohol consumption, and poor management of stress. Over the long term, 
hypertension leads to risk for cardiovascular events, such as heart disease, 
stroke, kidney failure, disability, and premature mortality. Cardiovascular 
events can be preventable when high-risk populations are targeted, for example, 
through population-wide screening strategies. When available resources are 
limited, taking a total risk approach whereby several risk factors of 
hypertension are taken into consideration (e.g. age, gender, lifestyle factors, 
diabetes, blood cholesterol) can enable more accurate targeting of high-risk 
groups. Targeting of high-risk groups can help reduce costs in that resources 
are not spent on the entire population. Early detection in the form of screening 
for hypertension (and associated risk factors) can help identify high-risk 
groups, which can result in timely treatment and management of risk factors. 
Ultimately, early detection can help reduce morbidity and mortality linked to it 
and can help contain health-related costs, for example, those associated with 
hospitalisation due to severe illness and poorly managed risk factors and 
comorbidities.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of different screening strategies for 
hypertension (mass, targeted, or opportunistic) to reduce morbidity and 
mortality associated with hypertension.
SEARCH METHODS: An Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Register of 
Studies (CRS-Web), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), 
MEDLINE, Embase, Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) 
Bireme, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International 
Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) without language, publication 
year, or publication status restrictions. The searches were conducted from 
inception until 9 April 2020.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs (NRCTs), 
that is, controlled before and after (CBA), interrupted time series (ITS), and 
prospective analytic cohort studies of healthy adolescents, adults, and elderly 
people participating in mass, targeted, or opportunistic screening of 
hypertension.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Screening of all retrieved studies was done in 
Covidence. A team of reviewers, in pairs, independently assessed titles and 
abstracts of identified studies and acquired full texts for studies that were 
potentially eligible. Studies were deemed to be eligible for full-text screening 
if two review authors agreed, or if consensus was reached through discussion 
with a third review author. It was planned that at least two review authors 
would independently extract data from included studies, assess risk of bias 
using pre-specified Cochrane criteria, and conduct a meta-analysis of 
sufficiently similar studies or present a narrative synthesis of the results.
MAIN RESULTS: We screened 9335 titles and abstracts. We identified 54 
potentially eligible studies for full-text screening. However, no studies met 
the eligibility criteria.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is an implicit assumption that early detection of 
hypertension through screening can reduce the burden of morbidity and mortality, 
but this assumption has not been tested in rigorous research studies. 
High-quality evidence from RCTs or programmatic evidence from NRCTs on the 
effectiveness and costs or harms of different screening strategies for 
hypertension (mass, targeted, or opportunistic) to reduce hypertension-related 
morbidity and mortality is lacking.

OBJECTIVES: China carries the greatest burden of stroke given its largest volume 
of people with hypertension. This study assessed the impacts of suboptimal 
controls of hypertension on incident stroke and projected the number of patients 
with stroke saved after the control of blood pressure improved in population.
SETTING: Anhui, China.
PARTICIPANTS: We examined data from the Anhui cohort of 2001-2011, consisting of 
3336 participants aged ≥60 years who were randomly recruited from the urban and 
rural Anhui. 2852 participants (89.2%) had hypertensive status measured and no 
stroke at baseline, and were followed up until 2011 in three surveys using a 
standard method of interview.
RESULTS: At baseline, 1646 participants (57.7%) were identified to have 
hypertension, among whom 912 (55.4%) were previously undetected, 115 (7.0%) 
detected but not treated, 452 (27.5%) treated but not controlled and only 127 
(7.7%) controlled. During the 10-year follow-up, 211 incident stroke cases 
(12.8/1000 person-years) occurred. Compared with normotensive individuals at 
baseline, multivariate adjusted HR for having stroke increased in those with 
undetected hypertension by 1.63 (95%CI 1.15 to 2.32), untreated by 2.21 
(1.26-3.85) and uncontrolled hypertension by 3.34 (2.28-4.88), but did not 
differ from those with controlled hypertension (1.34; 0.60-2.99). Based on a 
two-fold increase in the detection and management of current levels of 
hypertension and algorithms on the current situation in China, approximately 
250 000 incident stroke cases could be prevented annually.
CONCLUSIONS: In China, hypertension is frequently undetected or inadequately 
treated. With appropriate management of hypertension, a substantial number of 
people could be saved form stroke.

OBJECTIVES: To establish a new ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) parameter 
(24-hour ABP profile) and evaluated its performance on stroke outcome in 
ischaemic stroke (IS) or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) patients.
METHODS: The prospective cohort consisted of 1996 IS/TIA patients enrolled for 
ABP monitoring and a 3-month follow-up for stroke recurrence as outcome. Profile 
groups of systolic blood pressure (SBP) were identified via an advanced 
functional clustering method, and the associations of the profile groups and 
conventional ABP parameters with stroke recurrence were examined in a Cox 
proportional hazards model.
RESULTS: Three discrete profile groups (n=604, 781 and 611 in profiles 1, 2 and 
3, respectively) in 24-hour ambulatory SBP were identified. Profile 1 resembled 
most to the normal diurnal blood pressure pattern; profile 2 also dropped at 
night, but climbed earlier and with higher morning surge; while profile 3 had 
sustained higher nocturnal SBP without significant nocturnal SBP decline. The 
incidence of stroke recurrence was 2.9%, 3.9% and 5.5% in profiles 1, 2 and 3, 
respectively. After adjustment for covariates, profile 3 was significantly 
associated with higher risk of stroke recurrence with profile 1 as reference (HR 
1.76, 95% CI: 1.00 to 3.09), while no significant difference was observed 
between profiles 2 and 1 (HR 1.22, 95% CI: 0.66 to 2.25). None of conventional 
ABP parameters showed significant associations with the outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: Ambulatory 24-hour SBP profile is associated with short-term stroke 
recurrence. Profiles of ABP may help improve identification of stroke recurrence 
by capturing the additive effects of individual ABP parameters.

Visit-to-visit variability in systolic blood pressure (SBP) may have an 
important additional role in increasing the risk of vascular complications, 
including stroke. We conducted a meta-analysis to assess the relationship 
between visit-to-visit SBP variability (SBPV) and stroke risk. PubMed, EMBASE, 
and the Cochrane library databases were searched for cohort studies with data on 
visit-to-visit SBPV and stroke risk. Studies that reported adjusted relative 
risks (RRs) with 95% CIs of stroke associated with SBPV were included. Fourteen 
cohort studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in our 
meta-analysis. After adjustment for age, sex, and existing vascular risk 
factors, the analysis showed that the risk of stroke in patients with SBPV was 
significantly increased compared with patients with a small baseline SBPV [SD 
(RR=1.20, 95% CI=(1.07-1.35), P=0.0005), CV (RR=1.12, 95% CI=(1.00-1.26), 
P=0.008)]. In addition, follow-up variations of more than 5 years were 
associated with a higher risk of stroke than those of less than 5 years 
[RR=1.08, 95% CI=(1.04-1.11)]. Visit-to-visit SBPV was associated with an 
increased risk of stroke, especially in terms of the time of variation. Taken 
together, SBPV data may be useful as a preventative diagnostic method in the 
management of stroke.

High blood pressure (BP) is frequent in acute ischemic stroke (IS). However, the 
impact of BP change patterns during acute phase on clinical outcomes is not 
conclusive. This study aims to investigate the association between the 
acute-phase BP trajectories and clinical outcomes in IS patients with high 
admission BP. The cohort consisted of 316 IS patients with admission systolic BP 
(SBP) ≥160 mm Hg. SBP trajectories during the first 7 days after onset were 
characterized using a random effects model. The patients were classified into 
three groups based on the SBP trajectory curve parameters: sustained high SBP 
(T1), moderate decrease (T2), and rapid decrease in SBP (T3). Poor outcomes were 
defined as modified Rankin scale score ≥3 in 3 months after onset. The 
relationship between SBP trajectory groups and the outcome was examined in 
multivariable logistic regression models. The decreasing trend was greater in 
the favorable than in the poor outcome group (P = 0.028 for difference in linear 
slopes). The incidence of poor outcomes was 25.9%, 13.5%, and 9.8% in T1 
(n = 54), T2 (n = 170), and T3 (n = 92) groups, respectively. Compared with T1 
group, the decrease in SBP in T2 and T3 groups was significantly associated with 
lower risk of the poor outcome (odds ratio = 0.25, 95% confidence 
interval = 0.10-0.67, P = 0.006). These findings suggest that a decrease in BP 
in the acute phase is predictive of favorable outcomes in IS patients. BP 
trajectories have a greater power to detect the association than individual BP 
values at one time-point.

Background Survivors of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) are at increased risk for 
major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE), in the form of 
recurrent stroke and myocardial Infarction. We investigated whether long-term 
blood pressure (BP) variability represents a risk factor for MACCE after ICH, 
independent of average BP. Methods and Results We analyzed data from prospective 
ICH cohort studies at Massachusetts General Hospital and the University of Hong 
Kong. We captured long-term (ie, visit-to-visit) BP variability, quantified as 
individual participants' variation coefficient. We explored determinants of 
systolic and diastolic BP variability and generated survival analyses models to 
explore their association with MACCE. Among 1828 survivors of ICH followed for a 
median of 46.2 months we identified 166 with recurrent ICH, 68 with ischemic 
strokes, and 69 with myocardial infarction. Black (coefficient +3.8, SE 1.3) and 
Asian (coefficient +2.2, SE 0.4) participants displayed higher BP variability. 
Long-term systolic BP variability was independently associated with recurrent 
ICH (subhazard ratio [SHR], 1.82; 95% CI, 1.19-2.79), ischemic stroke (SHR, 
1.62; 95% CI, 1.06-2.47), and myocardial infarction (SHR, 1.54; 95% CI, 
1.05-2.24). Average BP during follow-up did not modify the association between 
long-term systolic BP variability and MACCE. Conclusions Long-term BP 
variability is a potent risk factor for recurrent hemorrhage, ischemic stroke, 
and myocardial infarction after ICH, even among survivors with well-controlled 
hypertension. Our findings support the hypothesis that combined control of 
average BP and its variability after ICH is required to minimize incidence of 
MACCE.

Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular events, including 
ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke. Reduction of blood pressure by lifestyle 
measures and antihypertensive drug therapy reduces stroke in elderly men and 
women. The use of diuretics, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, 
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers 
causes a similar reduction in reducing coronary events and stroke for a given 
reduction in blood pressure. The American College of Cardiology 
Foundation/American Heart Association 2011 expert consensus document on 
hypertension in the elderly recommended that the blood pressure should be 
reduced to less than 140/90 mm Hg in adults younger than 80 years at high risk 
for cardiovascular events. On the basis of data from the Hypertension in the 
Very Elderly trial, these guidelines recommended that the systolic blood 
pressure should be reduced to 140 to 145 mm Hg if tolerated in adults aged 
80 years and older. The 2013 European Society of Hypertension guidelines 
recommended that reducing blood pressure to less than 130/80 mm Hg in adults at 
high risk for cardiovascular events was unsupported by prospective trial data. 
The systolic blood pressure should be reduced to less than 140 mm Hg in these 
adults and to between 140 to 150 mm Hg in adults aged 80 years and older.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the risk probability and main influencing factors of 
stroke in followed-up hypertension patients through the analysis of long-term 
followed-up cohort data.
METHODS: The method of followed-up observation cohort was used to collect the 
information of 168,417 followed-up hypertension patients from 2002 to 2020 in 
Jiading District in Shanghai. Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyze the risk 
probability of stroke complications in long-term followed-up HTN patients, and 
the influencing factors were analyzed by Cox proportional risk model.
RESULTS: Among 168,417 followed-up hypertension patients, 11,143 cases had 
suffered stroke, and the cumulative incidence rate of stroke was 6.62% (male was 
6.87%, female was 6.37%). With the extension of the hypertension years, the 
cumulative risk probability of stroke in HTN patients would continue to increase 
and the interval was not equidistant. The total cumulative risk probability of 
stroke in HTN patients was 78.9% (male was 91.0%, female was 70.7%). During the 
period of hypertension, the risk occurring probability of stroke was not fixed, 
but fluctuating. There were 4 onset peaks, which were in 8 years (probability 
was 4.2%), 15 years (probability was 14.0%), 22 years (probability was 6.0%) and 
26 years (probability was 13.9%). The highest risk probability of male patients 
was in 26 years (probability was 23.1%), and the second peak was in 15 years 
(probability was 15.6%). The highest risk probability of female patients was in 
15 years (probability was 12.9%), and the second peak was in 26 years 
(probability was 8.7%). The risk probability of different gender, BP grade and 
BMI was different, the male were at higher risk than the female, stage 3 HTN was 
higher than stage 2 and stage 1 HTN, obese people and underweight people were at 
higher risk than those who have normal weight. The main factors closely related 
to the occurrence of stroke complications were age (RR = 2.917, p < 0.001), body 
mass index (RR = 1.654, p < 0.001), family history of stroke (RR = 1.386, 
p < 0.001) and blood pressure grade (RR = 1.148, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The risk probability of stroke among hypertension patients was high 
in followed-up hypertension patients (total 78.9%, male 91.0%, female 70.7%), 
and would continue to increase disproportionately during period of hypertension 
(4 different onset peaks). With the persistence of hypertension, the risk 
probability of stroke would increase continuously. Multivariate Cox regression 
analysis showed that male patients, patients with HBP, abnormal BMI and positive 
family history were main factors closely related to the occurrence of stroke 
complications.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies showed life satisfaction is related to reduced risk 
of coronary heart disease and diabetes, but its association with other 
cardiometabolic endpoints including hypertension and stroke remains unexplored. 
This study examined life satisfaction's prospective association with incident 
hypertension and stroke in middle-aged adults.
METHODS: At baseline (1985-1988), 6225 healthy British civil servants aged 35-55 
from the Whitehall II cohort completed the validated Satisfaction with Life 
Scale and provided information regarding sociodemographics, a range of 
health-related factors, and psychological distress. Incident hypertension was 
ascertained according to clinic-derived measures of systolic or diastolic blood 
pressure of ≥140/90 mmHg, respectively, or self-reports of either 
physician-diagnosed hypertension or hypertensive medication use. Incident stroke 
and transient ischemic attack (TIA) were ascertained by self-reported physician 
diagnosis. Follow-up assessments occurred every 2-5 years through 2017. Cox 
proportional hazards regression models estimated hazard ratios (HR) and 95% 
confidence intervals (CI) of hypertension and stroke/TIA risk separately.
RESULTS: Over a 31-year follow-up, 2703 cases of hypertension and 370 cases of 
stroke/TIA occurred. Life satisfaction was not related to risk of developing 
hypertension but was associated with 12% decreased risk of stroke/TIA after 
controlling for sociodemographics, health status, and health behaviors (HRper 
1-SD = 0.88; 95%CI = 0.79-0.98). However, the association was attenuated after 
adjustment for psychological distress.
CONCLUSIONS: No robust associations were found between life satisfaction and 
incident hypertension and stroke/TIA, respectively, after accounting for 
well-established risk factors and psychological distress. More research is 
needed to understand why associations of life satisfaction with cardiometabolic 
health seem to vary across endpoints.
