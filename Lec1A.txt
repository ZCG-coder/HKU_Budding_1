Finding trivial (patterns) in confounding (sample data)
claims -> proofs

mystery -> experimental design -> tools (determine truth from noise)
load data -> data manipulation -> statistics

mystery: longitivity (lifespan)
"why does some ppl live longer?"
determinants / contributing factors that can cause / related to longer life expectancy.

experiment, collect data
- Take a guess
    Make an assumption on why ...
- Find clues
    Collect data related to hypothesis
    (eg, related to economic -> collect economic data)
- Do study
    Create a test what actaully CAUSES the effect (eg longer life)

experimental design
Formulate theory
Develop hypothesis
Design experiment <- Experimental design
    Systematic design
Collect & analyze data

1. Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT)
Physicians' Health Study (1980s)
QUESTION: Can asprin lead to longer life?
METHOD: Massive, double-blind RCT w/ doctors
    DOUBLE-BLIND = no one knows which one is asprin
    RANDOM = completely no influence, separate into random group
    CONTROLLED = asprin is only changing factor
Some randomly take asprin (experiment), some take PLACEBO (a dummy pill) Fair Test (control)
RESULT: Asprin grp -44% heat attack
=> RCT can prevent heart attacks

2. data analysis
retroperspective: looking back
look backwards
    looking back at crime evidence after the fact
perspective: looking forward # if can
    collect patients into groups / follow patients
    following suspects to see what they do next

3. Statistics
a. Describe evidence
mean median variance
b. Testing theory
null vs alternative
c. solve
p-value & alpha

mean: add up and divide
median: middle
mode: most frequent
variance (spread): average squared difference from how far each number is deviated from mean.
std: sqrt(var)

Hypothesis testing
proposition tha tresearcher wish to verify

test:
1. Null hypothesis (H0)
    Assume there is no effect or difference between two variables
2. Alternative hypothesis (H1)
    Suggest there is an effect

inclusion criteria

eg. all boys are taller
    assertion / claim: all boys are taller
    develop null hypothesis: mean of distribution of height of male has no significant diff. with heights of fem. students
        T-distribution if null hypothesis is difference between two groups
    if p-value too low or too high reject hypothesis, even if difference is of a certain level
    -> alternative hypothesis is true.

bell cur. -> p-value
    middle = most evidence point to ...
    extreme = most evidence does not
    5% is rare enough
    p < 0.05: very unlikely for null hypothesis to occur -> statistically significant
    positive corerelation / negative correlation / no correlation

independent variables
    what we control

dependent variables
    measured

controls
    kept constant

correlation
    two variables move tgt. one change the other change
    +ve: both incr tgt
    -ve: one incr, other decr
causion (causitive / causual claim)
    one variable influences or causes a change in another
    direct link: clear cause-and-effect relationship - flip switch -> light on
    eg. asprin. retrospective studies are harder
    experimentation: needs controlled variables to prove
confounding factor

LINEAR REGRESSION
least squares regression

predicting outcome: find straight line that best describes relationship
best fit line: min dist. between all data pts. most accurate
make informed guesses

y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \epsilon
y: trying to predict
\beta_0: baseline: expected when x is 0
\beta_1: clue impact
x_1: indep. var
\epsilon: unexplained factors - clues can't solve. random variation / factors

magnitude of each factor measured by \beta_n

ASSIGNMENT DUE 31 DEC!!
