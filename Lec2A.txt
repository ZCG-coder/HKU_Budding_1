1. Performing thorough literature synthesis (systematic review)
2. Using structured frameworks (PICOS) to dissect evidence
3. Recognizing where evidence is missing
4. Understanding why gaps exist
5. Translating gaps into priorities for new research to enhance clinical decision-making

Eg smokers
how to convert smokers?
- dig into smokers
    -> ethical? ask ppl about trauma experience
    -> possible?
    => some projects are not possible to be done, as harm can be done on subjects

implementation science
"is a research going to impact human future?"
discover, create ideal pathways | in real life, never implemented
15 years for first line clinical practitioners to change their ways to comply with new studies

"is the research results going to be implemented"
barrier, facilitators

evidence -> intervention -> context -> implementation strategies -> outcomes (effectiveness, adoption, sustainability)
studies -> evidence-based practices -> organizational culture, resource availability, staff attitudes -> improved results

factors to consider (consolidated framework for Implementation research)
intervention characteristics, inner setting, implementation process, characteristics of individuals, outer setting

lung cancer
1. non-small cell cancer
mediastinum and hilar lymph node
2. small cell cancer
brain, liver...

"do not fabricate factors or numbers, write solely according to the file. output in authentic academic British-style British English"
雙重保障

PICO
Population / Problem, Intervention / Exposure, Comparison, Outcome

For ... (P), how does (I) affect (O) compared to (C)

MeSH word = preassigned words to search for smth
-> may need to use AI

creating literature table

Author, Year, Study Design, Population, Main findings, Limitations
"your supervisor would like to see..."

- do not ask AI to refer to previous prompts. always save output
- create systematic file names

evidence synthesis
-> answering research questions by literature
"conduct evidence synthesis based on.... output in layman terms"
effect modifiers: barriers...

consider socio-economic conditions

produce 2 versions
- pro versions / jargon version
- layman version
    need good balance of jargon and layman terms. some layman terms may not be comprehensible enough. around F4 eng
